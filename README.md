## Other:
Please mention the fact that I'm started my way as Front-end dev only 1.5(!) weeks ago. So don't be scared about all the code you can see here. My goal is to learn Front-end ASAP and start working, so please, if i didn't get this job and if that's not borrowing you - at least help me and tell me where i went wrong and how to make it better in details. Thanks!!!
