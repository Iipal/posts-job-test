## Getting Started

Install dependicies and run the development server:

```bash
$> npm i && npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Other:
Please mention the fact that I'm started my way as Front-end dev only 1(!) weeks ago. So don't be scared about all the code you can see here.
